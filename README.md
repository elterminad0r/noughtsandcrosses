# noughtsandcrosses
A CLI noughts and crosses framework in Python. It looks something like this:

	   0  1  2 
	0   |   |   
	 ---+---+---
	1   |   |   
	 ---+---+---
	2   |   |   
	You are playing as noughts
	Enter the position you want to play in > 1 1
	   0  1  2 
	0   |   |   
	 ---+---+---
	1   | O |   
	 ---+---+---
	2   |   |   

Minmax is also implemented - see `writeup.pdf`.
